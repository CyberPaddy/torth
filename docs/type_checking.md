# Type checking

Torth language is statically typed. Each value pushed to the stack has a type associated with it. Typing tries to ensure that the user only performs operations that are appropriate to the values of specific types.

## Types

- [BOOL](types.md#bool---boolean)
- [CHAR](types.md#char---character)
- [INT](types.md#int-uint8---integer)
- [PTR](types.md#ptr---pointer)
- [STR](types.md#str---string)
- [UINT8](types.md#int-uint8---integer)
