# Intrinsics

Intrinsics are built-in functions that generate static assembly output. The key difference between [keywords](keywords.md) and intrinsics is that the behavior of a keyword is dependent on other words in the program whereas intrinsic will always generate the same assembly output regardless of the context in which it is used.
