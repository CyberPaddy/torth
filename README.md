# Torth

It's like [Porth](https://gitlab.com/tsoding/porth) but written by a first-time programming language developer.

Torth is planned to be
- [x] Compiled
- [x] Native (Linux x86_64)
- [x] Stack-based (just like Porth)

## Examples

Program that adds two numbers and prints their sum

```pascal
420 917 + .
```

## Usage

```console
$ cat add_numbers.torth
420 917 + .
$ ./torth.py add_numbers.torth
1337
```
